These are refered to as Pure Functions.  Pure functions are highly modular as they do not affect any other part of the system and do not require complex threading for scalability.\nClojureScript\nClojureScript is Clojure that compiles to to JavaScript and runs in the browser (JavaScript Engine).  Most of the code and libraries available for Clojure works seamlessly when compiled to JavaScript.\nClojureScript is based heavily on the work done for Google Closures and there is a strong focus on Reactive client side apps.\nThere is a common file extension, .cljc that signifies Clojure code that is written to run on the JVM and JavaScript engines.\nClojure Community\nThere is a vibrant and highly active community around Clojure.

This is the essence of how a function works in Clojure.  So again, its really simple to build web apps with.\n  As Clojure is centered around dynamically typed & immutable data structures, it makes web applications really easy to build and simple to scale through parallelism.  As most of your application will be stateless, it is less complex and less prone to conflicts.\nLibraries over frameworks\n  Clojure also takes a very modular approach to building any application and has many great libraries to minimise the work involved.  As Java Interoperability is also very easy in Clojure, its trivial to use Java libraries too.\n  Web apps in Clojure are typically built from a collection of highly focused libraries, that complement each others functions.  Talking a modular approach, you can swap components & libraries easily should there be value in a different approach.  Common libraries for web app development include:\n\nRing - a web application library\nCompojure - an simple way to define routes for your ring webapp\nHiccup or [Selma]- write html in Clojure\nKorma, YesQL, hugSql - database abstraction layers\nclojure.java.jdbc or clojure.jdbc - low level SQL libraries\nPrismatic Schema - database schema mapping\nMigratus - database migrations (and all the things)\n\nThe closed thing to a framework in Clojure is Pedistal.  Frameworks constrain you to a certain approach to building apps and if you can live inside these constraints they can be very powerful.\nProject templates\n  You don't have to build projects from scratch each time, although this is a valid approach.  There are many great Clojure project templates available via the build automation tool, Leiningen\nProject templates are used as follows\nlein new template-name project-name\nThere are many great templates to try that provide insight into building webapps in Clojure.\n\ncompojure - a simple project with routing\nluminus - a production ready app template\nduct - simple, minimal production-grade framework\npedestal-service - an opinionated, extensible & scalable framework\n\nYou can find a range of project templates by searching for lein-template on Clojars.org.

Install by saving the Leiningen install script and running it inside a terminal window\n\nInstall script for Linux & MacOSX\nInstall script for Microsoft Windows\n\nSave the file to somewhere on your operating system path, eg ~/bin\nchmod a+x ~/bin/lein\nlein\n\n The first time you run this script it downloads a Java archive file (JAR) of the latest version of Leiningen.  When you run the script again, you have a working Leiningen build tool.\nDevelopment tools with Clojure support\nA tool that understands Clojure will help you write code faster and more accurately.  Here are a few common development tools used for Clojure\n\nLightTable - has an Instarepl that evaluates your code as you type, great for Clojure beginners\nEmacs  with either Emacs Live, Spacemacs or CIDER -  highly extensible support for Clojure, auto-completion, snippets, REPL & refactoring.\nNightcode - good for beginers, nice Clojure on Android support\nSublimeText - simple editor with basic Clojure awareness, used with lein repl on the command line\n\nClojure\nThere is no specific install for Clojure.  Clojure comes as a library, a JAR file, managed by the build tool Leiningen just like any other dependency.\nWhen you create a project with Leiningen, the configuration is created in a file called project.clj.  Inside this project.clj is a :dependencies entry where the version of clojure is specified along with any other dependencies.  Here is an example of a project.clj configuration with just Clojure as a dependency\n(defproject project-name \"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"\n  :description \"FIXME: write description\"\n  :url \"http://example.com/FIXME\"\n  :license {:name \"Eclipse Public License\"\n            :url \"http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html\"}\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \"1.8.0\"]])\n  The Clojure library is very small (~3.6Mb) and Leiningen caches it and all other libraries locally in the same folder structure that Maven uses, eg Clojure version 1.8.0 would be cached in ~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.8.0/\nHeroku Postgres\nThe web application will also use a database to persist state.  For this project we are using the Postgres relational database, an open source and well maintained project with all the features of a modern database you would expect.\nTo save on installation, we will use Heroku Posgres, a database on demand service that has a free tier for development.\nTo start with, create a free account on Heroku.  The step to create a database will be covered later on in the workshop.\n  Alternatively, you can install Posgres database locally on your laptop, however assistance with this is not provided.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"create-a-project/":{"url":"create-a-project/","title":"Create a Project","keywords":"","body":"Create a project\n  Lets create a project called todo-list using Leiningen, the build automation tool for Clojure.

A namespace limits the scope of functions and names of data structures to a specific namespace.\n  The names bound to function definitions using the defn function can be used elsewhere in the namespace just by using the name.  The same goes for any values bound to a name using the def function.\n Clojure order of evaluationThe code in a Clojure namespace is evaluated only once and from top to bottom.  To call a named function or data structure, it must have its definition evaluated first.\n  To use a function outside the namespace, you need to use its namespace and its name, for example clojure.string/reverse\nInclude another namespace in the REPL\n  The require function will provide access functions and names from specific namespaces and an alias for the namespace can also be specified with the :as directive.\n  A function from that namespace can then be used by prefixing its name with the alias specified in the require expression.\n  Here is an example of including the clojure.string namespace and calling its reverse fuction\n(require '[clojure.string :as string])\n\n(string/reverse \"RedRum\")\nIncluding another namespace in source code\n  Instead of the require function, add the :require keyword in the namespace definition, ns.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require '[clojure.string :as string))\n\n(string/reverse \"RedRum\")\n  If a funciton will be used many times in the namespace, you can :refer a function so you can call it just by name, as if it had been defined in the current namespace.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require '[clojure.string :refer [reverse]))\n\n(reverse \"RedRum\")\n  If you are using most functions from another namespace, you could :refer :all.  However, use this sparingly as it could lead to functions over-riding each other.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require '[clojure.string :refer :all))\n Dependency conflicts - avoid the use functionThe use function and :use within an ns definition are seen as a bad practice and should be avoided.The use function includes all the functions as if they had been written in the  including a great many unused functions into the namespace.  It will also pull in all the other namespace functions that each namespace included.As Clojure is typically composed of many libraries, its prudent to only include the specific things you need from another namespace.  This also helps reduce conflicts when including multiple libraries in your project.\nNamespaces outside the project\n  To use a namespace from a library that is not part of the project, you also need to include it as a dependency.

In our example, the first argument is an anonymous function that returns a map (the response to the browser request);  the second argument is a port number to run the jetty server on expressed as a Java Integer object.\n  The Integer. function is a call to java.lang.Integer.  The . is a special form that tells Clojure to treat this name as a call to Java.  See coersing types and java.lang\n  The :join? false setting enables the REPL prompt to run after the web server starts.  By default the join setting is true and the running server would block access to the REPL prompt.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"create-a-webserver-with-ring/coersing-types-and-java-lang.html":{"url":"create-a-webserver-with-ring/coersing-types-and-java-lang.html","title":"Theory: Coersing Types & java.lang","keywords":"","body":"Theory: Specifying Types & java.lang\nClojure has types that are created dynamically when the code is compiled, with everything being represented by Java objects as its compiled to Java bitecode.   However you do not need to specify any specific types as Clojure simply infers the type and handles most type collision gracefully.  The built in collections (list, map, vector & set) also support mixed types too.\nIn our project we are using Jetty, a web application server written in Java.  As its Java it needs a specific type of object passed as an argument for the port number, in this case an Integer.  However, when we run the Clojure project, the argument we supply for the port number on the command line is treated as a String object.  Therefore we need to change the port number from a Java String type to an Java Integer type.\nThe java.lang. library is part of all Clojure projects, so as we are going to create a Java Integer it makes sense to simply use the Integer constructor with a String argument which returns a new Integer object.\nThe Integer. port-number Clojure code is a short-hand for calling the java.lang.Integer constructor.  The . is actually a macro in Clojure that provides a simple way to work with Java, allowing you to call Java objects as if they were Clojure functions.  In Java you would have to use the form Type instance-name = new Type(argument).  In our example you would write this in Java as String port = new String(port-number)\n   From the Java 8 docs for Integer class:Integer(String s) - constructs a newly allocated Integer object that represents the int value indicated by the String parameter.\nTheory: Its Java Objects underneath strings & numbers\nStrings and numbers are represented by Java objects underneath, so its convienient to use Java Classes to manipulate these simple data structures on the rare occasion you need a specific type.\nYou can see the underlying Java types in Clojure using the type or class function.

One JVM is to run Leiningen and the second JVM is to run your application.  By using Leiningen to run your application in production you are using use extra resources and also risk pulling in unnecessary development libraries & configurationonly needed during development.\nWhen you run your application in production you can save resources by only running a JVM for your application.  This is done by running a Clojure application just like a Java application, using the java command in the Heroku Procfile.\nTheory: Building Clojure\nBuilding a Clojure project with Leiningen generates a Java jar file, a packaged version of your application.  A jar file generated from Java can be run using java -jar jar-file-name.jar.  However to run your Clojure jar file as a Java application you also need to include the the Clojure core library.\nLeiningen can also generate an Uberjar.  The uberjar is a jar file that also includes the Clojure library as well as your application and libraries.  As the uberjar contains Clojure, you can run an uberjar in any Java environment.\nBy adding an :uberjar entry to the project.clj then the Leiningen command lein uberjar is run during the build and an uberjar is created.\nWhen deploying on Heroku your application is built from your codebase using Leiningen, pulling in all the libraries your application depends on.  When your application is run it is done so as a Java application using the uberjarjust, starting just the one JVM.\nFurther reading: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-support\nTheory: Identifying an entry point for your application\nIf your main namespace doesn’t have a :gen-class then you can use clojure.main as your entry point and indicate your app’s main namespace using the -m argument in your Procfile:\nweb: java $JVM_OPTS -cp target/myproject-standalone.jar clojure.main -m myproject.web\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"heroku/deploy.html":{"url":"heroku/deploy.html","title":"Deploy to Heroku","keywords":"","body":"Deploy to Heroku\nFirst we need to create an Heroku app to deploy our Clojure webapp to.

However when a list is used as the paramter to a function call it can return a new list with different values.\nThe cons function is used to add values to the list\n(cons 5 '(1 2 3 4))\n\n;; => (5 1 2 3 4)\nYou will notice that the value 5 is added to the front of the new list that is returned.  As this is a linked list and not indexed, it is more performant to add values to the front of a list.\nHere is another example with strings\n(cons \"fish\" '(\"and\" \"chips\"))\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"persistent-data-structures/maps.html":{"url":"persistent-data-structures/maps.html","title":"Theory: Maps","keywords":"","body":"Theory: Maps\nA map in Clojure is a collection of key & value pairs in the form {key value}.  This kind of map is often referred to as a hash map in other languages.\nTypically a :keyword is used for the keys in a map as this provides a simple way to extract values (keywords act like a function call that returns the value they are associated with in the map)\nValues can be of any type, just like in other Clojure collections.  Values can also be defined as function calls or other collections including maps.\n{:key \"value\"}\n(:key 42)\n{:key :value}\n{\"key\" \"value\"}\n(\"key\" :value)\n\n{:a 1 :b 2 :c 3 }\nMaps of Maps\nIts common to have maps made up of other maps.

Any key must be unique within the scope of a map.\nThe following maps will throw duplicate key errors\n{\"fish\" \"battered\" \"chips\" \"fried\" \"fish\" \"battered and fried\"}\n{:fish \"battered\" :chips \"fried\" :fish \"battered & fried\"}\nDuplicate values are okay though\n{\"fish\" \"battered\" \"chips\" \"fried\" \"cod\" \"fried\"}\nThe same key can be used in a nested map.

The defroutes macro provides a simple syntax for defining routes and associating handler functions.\nWhat is a macro\nClojure has a programmatic macro system which allows the Clojure community to extend the language, rather than wait for the language designers.  This macro approach also helps keep the language very compact, with a minimum of primatives. \nWe have already used several macros in our code.  In our project.clj configuration we use the defproject macro to make it easy to define our Clojure project.  In our code we have used the defn macro to define names (symbols) for functions.\nPeeking under the covers\nYou can always look at what a macro is doing by using the macroexpand or macroexpand-all functions.  These functions show you what the code looks like after the macro-reader has processed the macro. \nTo expand a macro, require the clojure.walk library in your namespace\n[clojure.walk :as walk]\n\nThen wrap the macro you wish to explore with the macroexpand-all function.\n(walk/macroexpand-all \n '(defroutes myapp\n    (GET \"/\" [] \"Show something\")))\n\n\n(def myapp\n  (compojure.core/routes\n   (compojure.core/make-route\n    :get #clout.core.CompiledRoute{:source \"/\", :re #\"/\", :keys [], :absolute? false}\n    (fn* ([request__13075__auto__] (let* [] \"Show something\"))))))\n\nYou can see that the defroutes function expands to a make-route function that creates the details of the route and associates it with a handler or response map.The routes function join multiple routes together.\nFor further examples, see http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure-macros/\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"work-in-progress.html":{"url":"work-in-progress.html","title":"Work in Progress","keywords":"","body":"Work in Progress\nVariable tag names\nI have slightly variable html tag content based on some config being passed into a reagent component.

Here's an example where the namespace is given the alias r so that you can shorten the names.\n(require [interview.prompts.rawlist :as r])\n(r/your-function)\nYou can also refer to the full name at any time too:\n(interview.prompts.rawlist/another-fn)\nThere are many ways to use require, e.g. with refer if you don't want a prefix. Say you have 3 functions f1,f2,f3, then you can refer to them in these ways:\n(require [interview.prompts.rawlist :refer [f1 f2] :as r)\n(f1)\n(f2)\n(r/f3)\nNotice in third case, because it wasn't in the refer list, you have to use the r prefix.\nFor test folders, read the documentation for leiningen where it is explained, but basically boils down to:\n+ /interview\n|--+ src/\n|--+ test/\nand the sub-folder structure follows exactly the same pattern as the src dir.\nYou can add additional folders in project.clj using :source-paths and :test-paths keys in the main project macro. See the sample project for more information.\nI recommend you absorb everything in the sample project above, and also read the leiningen tutorial.\nFinally, when referring to functions in the ns declaration in other sources (e.g. in your tests) you use the same format, but using the :require form:\n(ns foo.bar\n  (:require [interview.prompts.rawlist :as r]))\n\n(r/foo-fn)\n\nElaborated from a stack exchange answer on the use of namespaces by Mark Fisher\n\nUsing Libraries\nThe use function also makes another libraries namespace accessible to the current one.  However use includes everything from the other library, it also makes everything part of the same namespace (ie. as if the functions, macros, name bindngs, etc were written in your library).\nTherefore the use function is usually avoided and require is used instead.  However, it can be convenient to make use of the 'use' function within the REPL as a way to include your project within the user namespace.  Being in the user namespace gives you access to the REPL tools (eg. doc, source, etc)\nExample\nLets make use of the use function to include a library called really-useful-code.core\n(use 'really-useful-code.core)\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };
